## Notes on Failures

- All 7 failures returned HTTP 200 with message: I could not generate a SQL query for that question.
- No invalid SQL was executed in failed cases.
- During testing, requests were run in two 10-question batches with server restart between batches to avoid rate-limit contamination in measurements.
